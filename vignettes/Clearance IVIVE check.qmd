## Introduction

This vignette is to showcase the use and comparison of differerent IVIVE frameworks for clearance and how the predicted clearance using the PK-Sim standard PBK models compares with observed plasma clearances. This framework will use the htpbk package also created by ESQlabs.

#### Import data

Import hepatic clearance data from paper of Poulin 2024...Maybe instead , use the data from Riley .. they have the original clearance

```{r}
Poulin_dataset<-read.csv("Poulin2025-JPharmaceuticalSciences-dataset.csv")
```

#### Import needed functions or packages

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

### Make batch simulations

1-Using standard IVIVE

2-Using standard IVIVE and no-limiting permeability

3-Correcting for fu-standard method

4-Correcting for fu-standard method and have no-limiting permeability

5-Correcting for fu-match partitioning method-\> RR

6-Correcting for fu-match partitioning method-\> RR

#### Compare predictiveness of different methods

Questions: Does fu lead to better prediction.

Are there cases where the permeability predicted by PK-Sim leads to permeability-limited clearance?

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
